Readme, written by Rob 1/14/18

Getting Concorde working can be a little complex:

You'll need "Concorde" source (co031219.tgz) to be unpacked 
into a "concorde" directory
You also need the Linear Programming solver QSOPT to exist 
on your system somewhere. Presumably it's in the same
directory as this README file "/QS/"

You'll want to run /src/concorde/configure as a script with
the following flags
./configure --with-qsopt=/dir/to/QS
then run 
"make"

You might run into problems with a 32 bit versoin running on
a 64 bit system. you need to do something to make gcc run with 
-m32 flags I think. 
Last time I got this working I installed some programs
sudo apt-get install g++-multilib
export CFLAGS='-m32'
export CXXFLAGS='-m32'
export LDFLAGS='-m32'

So who knows...

When you're done, there should be a directory /TSP/ with 
./concorde inside.  

Good luck!
